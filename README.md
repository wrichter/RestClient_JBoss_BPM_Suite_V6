RestClient JBoss BPM Suite V6
=============================

Simple sample on how to use the new RestClient to start a process via the REST-API.

The sample project is based on the standard process and data-structure provided by 
Eric Schabell on https://github.com/eschabell/bpms-mortgage-demo but can easily be changed to any other process.
